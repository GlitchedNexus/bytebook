One of the most common formats for storing tabular data is CSV (Comma-Separated Values).
CSV files are plain text files that use commas to separate values, making them easy to read and write.
They are widely supported by various software applications, including spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.

## Loading CSV Files

For Python projects it's often simpler and more powerful to use pandas for CSV handling.
Pandas reads CSVs directly into DataFrame objects which make data inspection and manipulation easy.

For this guide we will assume that we have a CSV file named `data.csv` located in a `data` directory within our project.

Let&apos;s take a look at a simple example of how to read a CSV file using pandas:

export const exampleCode = `import pandas as pd\n\n# Read CSV into a DataFrame\n# (pandas will infer types and use the first row as headers by default)\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/data.csv')\n\n# Show the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n\n# Iterate rows if you need row-by-row processing\nfor index, row in df.iterrows():\n    print(row.to_dict())\n`;

export const fileName = "loader.py";
export const highlights = [];

<Code lang="python" code={exampleCode} title={fileName} mark={highlights} />

The above code demonstrates reading a CSV into a DataFrame and iterating over rows.
Adjust the file path to match your project layout. Pandas also provides convenience methods for inspecting the data (e.g., `df.head()`, `df.info()`, `df.describe()`).

## Handling Alternate Delimiters

Sometimes CSV files may use alternate delimiters other than commas, such as tabs or semicolons.
If your CSV uses a different delimiter (for example, semicolons), you can pass the `sep` argument to `pd.read_csv`
to specify the delimiter as shown below:

export const delimiterExample = `import pandas as pd\n\n# Read CSV with semicolon delimiter\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/data.csv', sep=';')\nprint(df)\n`;

<Code lang="python" code={delimiterExample} title={"delimiter.py"} mark={[]} />

## Handling CSV without Headers

Pandas uses the first row as column names by default. You can control header behavior with the `header` and `names` parameters. For example, if your CSV file does not have a header row, you can set `header=None` and provide column names using the `names` parameter:

export const headerExample = `import pandas as pd

# Read CSV using the first row as header\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/data.csv', header=0)

# If the CSV has no header row, provide column names explicitly\ndf_no_header = pd.read_csv('data/data.csv',\n\theader=None,\n\tnames=['col1', 'col2', 'col3']\n)\nprint(df_no_header)

`;

<Code lang="python" code={headerExample} title={"header.py"} mark={[]} />

You can also use the `names` parameter to assign custom column names when the CSV has a header row but you want to override them.
