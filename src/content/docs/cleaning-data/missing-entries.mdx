Often times, datasets will have missing entries. This can be due to a variety of reasons,
such as data corruption, incomplete data collection, or intentional omission.
Handling these missing entries is crucial for accurate data analysis and modeling.

Since we are using pandas, we can take advantage of its built-in functions to handle missing data.

## Identifying Missing Data

Pandas provides several functions to identify missing data. The most common ones are `isnull()` and `notnull()`.

export const identifyMissingCode = `import pandas as pd

# Load data into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/data.csv')

# Identify missing entries\nmissing = df[df.isnull().any(axis=1)]\nprint(missing)`

<Code
  lang="python"
  code={identifyMissingCode}
  title={"identify_missing.py"}
  mark={[]}
/>

The `isnull()` function returns a DataFrame of the same shape as the original,
but with boolean values indicating whether each entry is missing (True) or not (False).

## Handling Missing Data

There are several strategies to handle missing data, including:

1. **Removing Missing Data**: You can remove rows or columns with missing data using the `dropna()` method.
2. **Filling Missing Data**: You can fill missing data with a specific value or a computed value (like mean, median, etc.) using the `fillna()` method.

### Removing Missing Data

export const removeMissingCode = `import pandas as pd
# Load data into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/data.csv')

# Remove rows with missing data\ndf_cleaned = df.dropna()\nprint(df_cleaned)`

<Code
  lang="python"
  code={removeMissingCode}
  title={"remove_missing.py"}
  mark={[]}
/>{" "}

By default, `dropna()` removes any row with at least one missing value.
You can change this behavior by using the `how` parameter, which can be set to `'any'` (default) or `'all'`.
If you set it to `'all'`, only rows with all values missing will be removed.

### Filling Missing Data

Pandas provides the `fillna()` method to fill missing data with a specific value or a computed value of your choice. For example, to fill missing values with a specific value (e.g., 0):

export const fillMissingCode = `import pandas as pd

# Load data into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/data.csv')

# Fill missing data with a specific value\ndf_filled = df.fillna(0)\nprint(df_filled)`

<Code
  lang="python"
  code={fillMissingCode}
  title={"fill_missing.py"}
  mark={[]}
/>

You can also fill missing data with computed values. For example, to fill missing values with the mean of the column:

export const fillWithMeanCode = `import pandas as pd

# Load data into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/data.csv')

# Fill missing data with the mean of the column\ndf_filled = df.fillna(df.mean())\nprint(df_filled)`;

<Code
  lang="python"
  code={fillWithMeanCode}
  title={"fill_with_mean.py"}
  mark={[]}
/>

This will replace all missing values in the DataFrame with the mean of their respective columns.
You can also use other statistical measures like median or mode, depending on your data and analysis needs.
